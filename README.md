Predicts the sender of a text
Import a whatsapp chat with a friend into txt file, this would be serve as the trainfile called 
It should ideally be more than 2000 chats
Make a file where you put the text of a person.
Make sure you put it in one line
It should be only the text without any sender name and time.
Run the code.
python classifier.py --trainfile (name.txt) --testfile(test.txt)

I have uploaded a sample wp text file, I found online.


Download the Zip file, unzip it into a folder. Place the classifier.py file in that folder only
Good luck.

ON my way to increase support for group chats
